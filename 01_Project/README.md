Project Overview: Taxi Patterns in New York City
This project focuses on analyzing taxi data in New York City to uncover key patterns and insights.
By examining various aspects such as peak times, airport fees,
and busy days, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of taxi operations and passenger behavior.


Additionally, the project uses Parquet files instead traditional CSV files.
Since they are more efficient for large volumes of data, I had to figure out how to process them.
