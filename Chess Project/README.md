# Chess app

## My file structure

Hi this is a guide on my file structure, it tells you which files to ignore and which ones to use.

First ignore all the files on this level and open the "A_Working_ones" folder.
Next the two python files you need are called "chess_server.py" and "chess_client.py".

Next you need to keep  the folder "chess pieces" -> "all pieces" and the images stored inside of it, they will be used to create the images of the different chess pieces. 

The last file needed is "settings.txt". 

All work is in the MAIN Branch.

## Installations

The python files were run on python 3.12.0 (64 bit)
You will need to install various packages using pip.
These are: python-chess, tkinter, customtkinter, pillow.

## Common mistake - MUST READ

When running the client or server the project should be opened inside the "A_Working_ones" folder.
