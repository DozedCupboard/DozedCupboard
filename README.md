- 👋 Hello visitor
- 👀 I’m interested in Data analysis, SQL, Python and PowerBI, and Web development

I have 3 Data Projects

The One project combines sql and power bi to produce an analysis on a
cardiovascular disease dataset. 
- It is called "Cardio analysis". (Read the PDF)

Another is an analysis on Yellow Taxi's in new york and insights gained
from the analysis.
- It is stored in the "01_Project" Folder. (Look at PDF)

Additional there is a Power BI project that explores data on a survey about 
computer science professions.
- It is called "Power BI.pdf".
