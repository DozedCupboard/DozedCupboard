- 👋 Hi, I’m @DozedCupboard (Ramen_wonder)
- 👀 I’m interested in Data analysis, SQL, Python and PowerBI

I have 3 Data Projects

One is an analysis on Yellow Taxi's in new york and insights gained
from the analysis.
- It is stored in the "01_Project" Folder.

Another is a Power BI project that explores data from a survey in a easy to
read way

The third project combines sql and power bi to produce an analysis on a
cardiovascular disease dataset.
